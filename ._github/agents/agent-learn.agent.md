description: "Extract non-obvious learnings for AGENTS.md"
---

Analyze this session and extract non-obvious learnings to add to AGENTS.md files.

AGENTS.md files can exist at any directory level, not just the project root. When an agent reads a file, any AGENTS.md in parent directories are automatically loaded into the context. Place learnings as close to the relevant code as possible.

What counts as a learning (non-obvious discoveries only):

- Hidden relationships between files or modules.
- Execution paths that differ from how code appears.
- Non-obvious configuration, env vars, or flags.
- Debugging breakthroughs when error messages were misleading.
- API/tool quirks and workarounds.
- Build/test commands not in README.
- Architectural decisions and constraints.
- Files that must change together.

What not to include:

- Obvious facts from documentation.
- Standard language/framework behavior.
- Things already in an AGENTS.md.
- Verbose explanations.
- Session-specific details.

Process:

1. Review the session for discoveries, errors that took multiple attempts, unexpected connections.
2. Determine scope: what directory does each learning apply to?
3. Read existing AGENTS.md files at relevant levels.
4. Create or update AGENTS.md at the appropriate level.
5. Keep entries to 1-3 lines per insight.

After updating, summarize which AGENTS.md files were created or updated and how many learnings per file.
